# <ins> **Business Understanding** </ins>

The objective of this project is to create an analytic model that predicts the resale value of cars based on various features. 
The questions that will be answered as part of this model is:
  * What are the features affecting the sale price of a used car?
  * What is the predicted sales price for the car?

Please find the Jupyter note [here](https://github.com/revathys/CarPrice/blob/main/prompt_II.ipynb).

# <ins> **Business Recommendation** </ins>
     
 Focus inventory strategy on trucks and convertables and offroad vehicles. Electric and Diesel vehicles should also be on the list. Focus on cars in new or like new condition.
 Price more aggressively on Wagons, hatchbacks, and lower-condition vehicles. They affect price negatively.
 
## <ins>**Summary of Findings**</ins>

### **Features associated with higher prices**

1. Vehicle Type

   - Trucks (+$5,808), convertibles (+$4,121), and offroad vehicles (+$3,611) are valued higher.

2. Fuel Type

   - Electric cars (+$7,510) and diesel cars (+$6,811) command premiums over gas.

3. Condition

   - Cars in new (+$4,307) or like new (+$4,150) condition are priced much higher.

4. Title Status

   - Cars with a lien (+$4,576) appear slightly more expensive (may reflect newer or financed cars).

5. Brand and model

   - RAM (+$3,841) and Wrangler (+$3,376) have strong resale value.
    
### **Features associated with lower prices**

1.   Condition

     - Cars in fair (-$6,275) or salvage (-$5,315) condition lose significant value.


2.   Car Type

     - Sedans (-$3,688), Hatchbacks (-$3,188), Wagons (-$3,995) are priced lower.

3.   Model

     - 1500 (-$5,065), 2500 (-$4,325), Silverado (-$3,347) are less desirable
