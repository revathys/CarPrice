# CarPrice

**Business Understanding**
The objective of this project is to create an analytic model that predicts the resale value of cars based on various features. 
The questions that will be answered as part of this model is:
  * What are the features affecting the sale price of a used car?
  * What is the predicted sales price for the car?

Please find the Jupyter note [here](https://github.com/revathys/CarPrice/blob/main/prompt_II.ipynb).

**Business Recommendation**
     
 Focus inventory strategy on trucks and convertables, electric/diesel vehicles, and cars in new/like new condition, while pricing more aggressively on Wagons, hatchbacks, and lower-condition vehicles.
 
**Summary of Findings**

**Features associated with higher prices**

1. Vehicle Type

  - Trucks (+$5,416), convertibles (+$3,722), and offroad vehicles (+$3,170) are valued higher.

2. Fuel Type

    - Electric cars (+$5,069) and diesel cars (+$4,641) command premiums over gas.

3. Condition

   - Cars in new (+$4,998) or like new (+$4,913) condition are priced much higher.

4. Title Status

   - Cars with a lien (+$4,714) appear slightly more expensive (may reflect newer or financed cars).

5. Brand and model

   - RAM (+$3,768) and Wrangler (+$3,287) have strong resale value.
    
**Features associated with lower prices**
1.   Condition
   
     - Cars in fair (-$5,497) or salvage (-$4,446) condition lose significant value.

3.   Car Type

     - Wagons (-$4,361), sedans (-$4,075), hatchbacks (-$3,565), and minivans (-$3,198) are less desirable.

3.   Fuel

     - Gas (-$3,870) and hybrid (-$3,805) cars are priced lower compared to electric/diesel.

4.   Model

     - 500 (-$4,547) and 2500 (-$3,803) models
